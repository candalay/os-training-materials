A taste of training
===================

This repository contains a small selection of notebooks we use in our training materials:

- The material about context managers comes from our [Data Science with Python] training;
- The material about Spark DataFrames comes from our Data Science with Spark training;
- The material about Time Series comes from our [Data Science Accelerator Program].

The notebooks can be opened to get a feeling of how the trainings are. For reference, the slides
are present as well. To be able to see the slides properly, be sure to clone the repository like so

```sh
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/godatadriven/os-training-materials
```

Then open the html files with your favourite browser (not tested on Internet Explorer version 6,
sorry).
